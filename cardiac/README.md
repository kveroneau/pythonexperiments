Cardiac CPU Simulator
---------------------

As seen on my [blog](http://www.pythondiary.com/blog/Oct.15,2014/building-cpu-simulator-python.html) 
Cardiac was a tool made back in the 60s to teach people how a computer processes data,
although this is very old, most of it is still rather revelant, as computers still process data
in a similar method.  Although computers now have many more opcodes and many more registers, this
tool here can be helpful in an education environment to teach how a computer actual works.

I would recommend download the PDF manual for the Cardiac to use as a teaching tool, as there
are many examples and explainations in there that can be used.

#### What can this teach besides CPU simulation?

 *  Python classes
 *  Python Mixins
 *  Overriding/overloading methods
 *  Pluggable Python classes
 *  Python introspection
 *  Perhaps more...

Overall, in a learning environment for just teaching Python, this example could be
very usable as a teaching aid.

Future updates will include both a fully working compiler.
